Notes:
We feel we worked well together - we separated out the work initially, and collaborated once we had a baseline of classes created.  We worked together on debugging and feel it was a good amount of effort from everyone.  We learned from one another, and helped each other out. Perhaps one opportunity for improvement is GitHub / versioning.  We tended to treat Dee's branch as the main branch.
