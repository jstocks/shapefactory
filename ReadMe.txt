Notes:
We feel we worked well together - we separated out the work initially, and collaborated once we had a baseline of classes created.  We worked together on debugging and feel it was a good amount of effort from everyone.  We learned from one another, and helped each other out. Perhaps one opportunity for improvement is GitHub / versioning.  We tended to treat Dee's branch as the main branch.

Shortcomings: 
- Rectangles can be creates with same Length and Width parameter (technically making it a square) but our program does not recognize this. 
- Triangles can be made with any size parameters. Height can be 1,000,000 while base length, side_length1, and side_length2 have lengths of 1. A triangle cannot have these dimmensions but our program does not recognize this as an issue.
